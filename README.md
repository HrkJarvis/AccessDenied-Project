Covid -19: Creating a Realtime CoronaVirus Outbreak Notification System Using Python Programming
In this tutorial, we will learn to program a “Realtime Coronavirus Outbreak Notification System” using Python.

Functionality:
This program will give you the real-time update about the number of new cases, deaths, and the recovered cases of coronavirus according to time (after 1 hour or 2 hours) within a state. It will also provide information about how many of them are Indian national and foreign nationals.

Prerequisite: The prerequisite of this project is the basic knowledge of python.


 
As this is the desktop notifier application, we will be using the plyer module in our program.  The Plyer module does not come built-in with Python. To install it externally, write the following command on your terminal:

pip install plyer
bs6 pakage
